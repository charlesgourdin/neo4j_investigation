# Finding rogue MI6 agents !

## Plot

You are an MI6 analyst based in London. Some agents have been under investigation for fraud and collusion in the government. The MI6 wants to make sure there is no officers having had any suspicious contact with persons involved in crimes while they were under investigation by that same officer. Time limit to solve: none.

## Objective

Given the dataset at your disposal, find (if any!) officers that have had suspicious relationships with persons involved in crimes that this Officer is investigating.

More precisely, an officer is suspicious if â€¦ 
He has a family relationship (FAMILY_REL), phone calls (CALLER or CALLEE), or knows (KNOWS) any person involved in a crime(PARTY_TO) that he/she is himself/herself investigating (INVESTIGATED_BY)

## My analysis

You can connect to API on the following link : https://murmuring-hollows-41110.herokuapp.com/

First of all, the first thing that challenges me in the diagram is the unique relationship of the "officer" node. This node is connected to the "crime" node, so I deduce that there can be no relationship between an officer and a person other than through a crime..

But let's imagine what the investigation could have yielded in such a case. The idea in this first request is to verify that there is no suspicious relationship between an officer and a person related to the same crime. We will therefore verify that they do not know each other, that they have never called each other and that they are not related. 

The result can be seen at the following endpoint and logically does not give any conclusive result ->  https://murmuring-hollows-41110.herokuapp.com/investigation-result

To go further, although we are getting out of the graph use case, I decided to check if there were officers with the same surnam as a person. 

The results show us that this is the case for 3 officers -> https://murmuring-hollows-41110.herokuapp.com/have-same-name

From there we can make 3 checks. 

1) The first is to check if an officer has the same surname as the person he is investigating or one of his direct relation. 

This does not give any result -> https://murmuring-hollows-41110.herokuapp.com/have-name-relation

2) The second is to check whether a person with the same name as the investigating officer may have had a telephone conversation with the suspect. 

This does not give any result to -> https://murmuring-hollows-41110.herokuapp.com/have-phone-relation

3) Finally, the last one is to check whether the crime occurred at the address of a person of the same name as the officer. 

Still no results... -> https://murmuring-hollows-41110.herokuapp.com/have-location-relation

I deduce that all the officers are perfectly clean, end of the investigation!
